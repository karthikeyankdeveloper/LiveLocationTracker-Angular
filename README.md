The main purpose of this web application is to provide the user with a very smooth and enjoyable real-time location tracking experience. The system utilizes the GPS module of NodeMCU to obtain the device's current location and transmits it to a remote server via Wi-Fi connectivity. The server then renders the location on a map in real-time, allowing the user to track the device's movement. The tracker kit can be purchased by the user, which will enable them to access the realtime location of the device. The app is designed for businesses looking to optimize their fleet operations and for individuals seeking to keep track of their personal assets.
